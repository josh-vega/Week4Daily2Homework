Instructions:
************************** Homework Week 4 Day 2   *****************************
1.  Create 2 different Object (Home and Office) with 4 different fields.
2.  Create 4 different views(Remember what is a view in MVP), one for displaying and one for data entry, for each Object
3.  Create a user interface for all the above that allows for some sort of navigation.  (I am vague on this on purpose, be creative, look up some ui items, experiment)
